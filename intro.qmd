# Sentinel-1 Quick Facts

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}
- Synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) is a form of radar that is used to create 2D images or 3D reconstructions of objects, such as landscapes.
- It has four operational/acquisition modes and four types of data products.
- One satellite in orbit, one defected, two more should be operational in 2024.

# Sentinel-2 Quick Facts

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}
- High spatial resolution (10m-60m) optical imagery systematically acquired over land and coastal waters.
- Two satellites are in orbit (A and B) and a third one (Sentinel-C) will be launched in 2024.
- Multispectral data with 13 bands in the visible, near infrared, and short wave infrared part of the spectrum.
